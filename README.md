This tutorial describes how to create a basic bot with the Bot Framework SDK. If you've already created a basic bot and have it running locally, read the Tutorial: Deploy a basic bot article.

You will learn how to:

Create a basic bot
Run the bot on your local machine
Test it using the Bot Framework Emulator


Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
Bot Framework Emulator is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

Install the latest Bot Framework Emulator from here
Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
Launch Bot Framework Emulator
File -> Open Bot
Enter a Bot URL of http://localhost:3978/api/messages

Interacting with the bot
The primary goal when creating any bot is to engage your user in a meaningful conversation. One of the best ways to achieve this goal is to ensure that from the moment a user first connects, they understand your botâ€™s main purpose and capabilities, the reason your bot was created. See Send welcome message to users for additional information on how a bot can welcome users to a conversation.
